### **Day 3-4: Production Pipeline**
```bash
# Create automated data pipeline
touch src/pipeline/data_fetcher.py
touch src/pipeline/feature_engineer.py
touch src/pipeline/predictor.py
```

**Priority Tasks:**
- [ ] Automated FPL API data fetching (daily)
- [ ] Real-time feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Model prediction automation
- [ ] Database integration for storing predictions

### **Day 5-7: Web Interface**
```bash
